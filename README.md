# Cancellation-of-hotel-bookings
"This project is a guided exploration of data analysis and predictive modeling techniques in the domain of hotel bookings. Under the guidance of Shan Singh (instructor of the course 'Machine Learning Real-World Projects in Python' on Udemy), I have successfully completed various steps of data analysis and developed a model to predict hotel booking cancellations. 

While following the guidance provided by Shan Singh, I have added my own unique features and enhancements to the project. Moving forward, I will continue to add more features and enhancements to further improve the predictive model and expand its capabilities.
